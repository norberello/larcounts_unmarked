This script is a first try to fit several models explaining lar gibbon count abundance in the landscape using N-mixture models by means of the unmarked R package. It aims to plot the predicted lar abundance by the variables defined by the best model. The count of gibbon groups were made at 64 listening posts separated by 2,250m that were revisited 5 days from 6-12am. Note that the data including counts are not complete and covariates aren't definitive; this script is made for the sake for sharing the best way of doing it and hopefully receive advice and help from the super experts in the GitHub community.
