#let's prepare the unmarked frame
#the date covariates are the 5 days of listening
#I don't want to put observation covariates
#as I think there isn't any that affects observation quality
#but, it seems that it is compulsory
#so let's make them as the 5 days
#but in the methods just go for enviromental covariates
#is this correct?

siteCovs(lar.frame) <- sc

#this is great!

#let's just have a model for simplicity with the variables I think explain best
#gibbon group counts
#HQ: distance to HeadQuarters (protection)
#The elevation is expresses as its quadratic function
#Stream: length of rivers in the area, streams might be associated
#to more riparian vegetation
#Pil: the presence of a siter gibbon species: competition for space
